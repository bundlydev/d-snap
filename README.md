# dSnap

Welcome to your new dSnap project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

It contains the development of a middleware tool that we use to authenticate users using Internet Identity on mobile devices.

## Project structure

  - Utils.mo

frontend

- apps
  - internet-identity-middleware
  - mobileapp
  - webapp

  - ic-core-js
  - ic-react
  - ic-react-native

## Installing OS Dependencies

### UNIX/Linux

```bash
sudo apt install clang
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libssl-dev
sudo apt install pkg-config
```

### Mac

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Install project dependencies

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
yarn global add turbo
yarn
```

## Environment variables setup

Some apps contain a `.env-example` file; you must copy it in the same location and replace the values with your own.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

<<<<<<< HEAD

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

# Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

### Run local replica

```bash
# Starts a local ICP replica, running in the background
yarn serve
```

Or run a clean replica:

```bash
# Starts a local ICP replica, running in the background. It cleans existing data (incluiding canister ids and stable memory)
yarn serve:clean
```

### Prepare project

```bash
# Generates canister type declarations
yarn generate

# Register unique canister identifiers on th local network
yarn canister:local:create
```

### Run apps

```bash
# Deploys backend canisters to the local replica and generates their candid interface
# Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.
yarn deploy:local:backend

# Run frontend apps in dev mode
yarn dev
```

### Run canister changes

```bash
# Generates canister type declarations
yarn generate

# Deploys backend canisters to the local replica and generates their candid interface
yarn deploy:local:backend

# Run frontend apps in dev mode
yarn dev
```

### Adding a new backend canister

If you create a new backend canister, you need to build its corresponding types to enable it for the frontend. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Generates canister type declarations
yarn generate

# Deploys backend canisters to the local replica and generates their candid interface
yarn deploy:local:backend

# Run frontend apps in dev mode
yarn dev
```

### Test frontend apps in local replica

Once you are ready, if you want to test your frontend code before deploying it to the mainnet, follow these steps:

```bash
# Generates canister type declarations
yarn generate

# Builds frontend production bundles
yarn build

# Deploys all canisters to the local replica and generates their candid interface
yarn deploy:local
```

### Troubleshoting

#### Start clean replica

Every time you run ` yarn serve:clean`, follow it up with `yarn canister:local:create` and `yarn deploy:local:backend`, then run `yarn dev`.

## General troubleshoting

### Out of cycles

If you receive an error like this:

```
The replica returned a replica error: reject code CanisterError, reject message Canister aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaa is out of cycles: please top up the canister with at least 2_301_457_384_782 additional cycles, error code None
```

Run `yarn stop` and `yarn serve:clean`

## DOC DEPRECATED

> > > > > > > develop

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

=======

> > > > > > > develop

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
