# dSnap

Welcome to your new dSnap project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

## Install OS Dependencies

### UNIX/Linux

```bash
sudo apt install clang
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install libssl-dev
sudo apt install pkg-config
```

### Mac

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Install project dependencies

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
yarn global add turbo
yarn install
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Generates canister type declarations
yarn generate

# Register unique canister identifiers on th local network
yarn canister:local:create

# Starts a local ICP replica, running in the background
yarn serve

# Deploys backend canisters to the local replica and generates their candid interface
yarn deploy:local:backend

# Run frontend apps in dev mode
yarn dev
```

## DOC DEPRECATED

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
